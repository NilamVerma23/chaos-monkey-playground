# Chaos Monkey Playground

An experimental chaos engineering lab built on AWS, Terraform, Docker, and GitHub Actions. This project simulates real-world failure scenarios—like instance shutdowns and resource exhaustion—to test and improve cloud system resilience.

### About Me

I'm a Service Desk Analyst with 3+ years of experience supporting enterprise IT infrastructure at a multinational corporation. After working on real-time escalations, outages, and recovery workflows, I became passionate about automation, fault tolerance, and building systems that thrive under stress.

This project is part of my transition into DevOps engineering—bringing together my frontline support background and new skills in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and chaos testing.

### Key Technologies
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, Route53)
- **Automation:** Terraform, GitHub Actions
- **Containers:** Docker
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Scripting:** Shell, Python

### Objectives
- Test infrastructure resilience through automated chaos experiments
- Build and deploy infrastructure as code using Terraform
- Observe impact and recovery using monitoring tools and alerts
